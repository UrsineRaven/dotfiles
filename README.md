My Linux dotfiles

To restore them to a new machine, run:  
`curl -Lks https://github.com/UrsineRaven/dotfiles/raw/master/.local/bin/pull_dotfiles.sh | /bin/bash`

TODO:
* give credit to [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz) for inspiration
* actually make changes to .vimrc
* further configure i3
* configure i3blocks and add its dot file
* setup script to pull news from Arch Linux website (probably 13blocks module to notify of new articles)
