My Linux dotfiles

TODO:
* add script to automatically pull this to a new setup ([reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles))
* figure out curl command to pull the script and run it
* give credit to [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz) for inspiration
* actually make changes to .vimrc
* further configure i3
* configure i3blocks and add its dot file
* setup script to pull news from Arch Linux website (probably 13blocks module to notify of new articles)
